# What is "AKKA Pi on Gradle"?

A sample AKKA project based on AKKA docs that calculates Pi using actors and is built as a multi project Gradle beast

## Why would I do such a thing?

+ To demostrate the ultimate power of Gradle in Scala world
+ As well as to throw AKKA in a mix to get a full "scratch" / "start up" kit
